      "3. **Model**: A machine learning model is the result of training an algorithm on a dataset. The model can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\n",
      "4. **Training**: The process of training a model involves feeding it a large amount of data and adjusting the algorithm's parameters to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes.\n",
      "5. **Testing**: Once a model is trained, it is tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance and accuracy.\n",

      "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, and the goal is to discover patterns or structure in the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\n",
      "3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. This approach is useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",
      "4. **Reinforcement Learning**: In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.\n",
